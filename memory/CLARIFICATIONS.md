## Open Questions for Backend/API Team

---

### 1. Dynamic Table Identifier Origin
**Question:** Where does the table identifier "पq" (or similar Devanagari/special characters) come from?

**Context:**
- Table card shows: `पq piyush ₹1`
- "piyush" appears to be the customer name
- "₹1" is the bill amount
- But what is "पq"? Is it:
  - A table number in Devanagari script?
  - An encoded/hashed table ID?
  - A dynamic table name created by the system?
  - A prefix for walk-in customers?

**Why it matters:** 
- Need to understand the data structure to enable search by customer name
- Currently, tables with such identifiers are not searchable

---

### 2. Dynamic Tables Data Source
**Question:** Where are dynamic/custom-named tables stored in the API response?

**Current Understanding:**
| Data Source | What it contains |
|-------------|------------------|
| `allTablesList` | Physical predefined tables (1, 2, 101, etc.) |
| `walkInOrders` | Auto-generated walk-ins (wc-xxxxx) |
| **??? (Unknown)** | Custom-named tables (पq, etc.) |

**Questions:**
- Are these in `dineInOrders` with a special flag?
- Is there a `tableType`, `isDynamic`, or `isCustomTable` field?
- What API field contains the customer name for these tables?

---

### 3. Table Number vs Customer Name Mapping
**Question:** How is the relationship between table identifier and customer name stored?

**Need to know:**
- API field for the "पq" part (is it `tableNumber`, `tableName`, `tableId`?)
- API field for the "piyush" part (is it `customerName`, `guestName`, `customer`?)

---

### 4. Search Requirements Clarification
**Question:** When searching for "piyush", should the system:
- a) Show the table in search dropdown?
- b) Filter dashboard to show only matching tables?
- c) Both?

**Current behavior:** Neither works for dynamic tables

---

## Pending Implementation (Blocked)

| Feature | Status | Blocker |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Search by customer name for dine-in | Blocked | Need Q1, Q2, Q3 answered |
| Dynamic table search | Blocked | Need data source identified |

---

## 5. Bill Collection During Order Preparation

**Question:** Should users be able to collect bill when the order is still in "Preparing" status?

**Recommendation:** **Option B (Flexible)** — Allow bill anytime after order placed.

**Pending:** Awaiting confirmation from product/backend team.

---

## 6. Order Timeline - API Timestamps (RESOLVED)

**Status:** Implemented. API provides timestamps at item level (`ready_at`, `serve_at`). Order-level timestamps computed from items.

---

## 7. FCM Webpush Payload (RESOLVED — shared with backend)

**Status:** Backend payload structure shared. Backend team has added `webpush` section.

**Pending verification:** User needs to confirm FCM notifications arrive with `data.sound` field.

**Required payload:**
```php
'webpush' => [
    'headers' => ['Urgency' => 'high'],
    'data' => ['sound' => $basename],
    'fcm_options' => ['link' => '/dashboard'],
],
```

## 11. Socket Event Map Per Flow (Updated April 13, 2026)

**Verified from user console logs across all order mutation flows:**

| Flow | Socket Events Received | Socket Lock Event | Has Payload? |
|------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **New Order (table)** | `update-table engage` → `new-order` (payload) | `update-table engage` | ✅ Yes (51 keys) |
| **New Order (walk-in)** | `new-order` (payload) | None | ✅ Yes |
| **Update Order** | `order-engage` → `update-order` (payload) | `order-engage` | ✅ Yes |
| **Switch Table (v2)** | 2x `update-table engage` (src+dest) → `update-order-target` (payload) | `update-table engage` (both tables) | ✅ Yes |
| **Merge Table (v2)** | 2x `order-engage` → `update-order-target` (payload) + `update-order-source` (payload) | `order-engage` (both orders) | ✅ Yes |
| **Transfer Food (v2)** | 2x `order-engage` → `update-order-target` (payload) + `update-order-source` (payload) | `order-engage` (both orders) | ✅ Yes |
| **Collect Bill** | Path updated to v2, socket behavior TBD | TBD | TBD |
| **Cancel Food (v2)** | `order-engage` → `update-order` (payload) | `order-engage` | ✅ Yes (verified Apr 13) |
| **Cancel Order** | 2× `update-table free` + `update-order-status` (no payload) | ❌ None | ❌ No — backend needs `order-status-update` fix |
| **Mark Ready** | `update-order-status` (no payload) | ❌ None | ❌ No — same endpoint |
| **Mark Served** | `update-order-status` / `update-food-status` (no payload) | ❌ None | ❌ No — same endpoint |
| **Cancel Food Item** | `update-table free` + `update-order-status` | `update-table free` (should be engage) | ❌ No (v1) |

**Key insight:** 8 flows are v2 CLEAN with full payloads. 3 remaining dirty flows (Cancel Order, Mark Ready, Mark Served) all share one backend endpoint `order-status-update` — one backend fix covers all 3.

---

## 12. Local Locking Audit (April 11, 2026)

**Principle established:** Locking must ONLY come from socket events. All local locking to be removed.

**What "local locking" means:** Frontend code calling `setTableEngaged(true)` or `waitForTableEngaged()` without a corresponding socket event triggering it.

**Correct approach per flow:**
- If `update-table engage` will arrive → wait for it
- If `order-engage` will arrive → wait for it
- If neither will arrive → no wait (fire & close)

**`waitForTableEngaged` is the wrong abstraction** — it only handles one case. Needs flow-specific replacement.

---

## 8. HTTP Response vs Socket Timing for New Order (April 10, 2026)

**Observation:** When placing a new order, the HTTP POST response arrives AFTER socket events.

**Timeline observed:**
| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 21:22:16 | Socket: `update-table engage` |
| 21:22:18 | Socket: `new-order` (complete order data) |
| 21:22:18 | HTTP response: `{order_id: 730750, ...}` |

**Question:** Why does HTTP response still return after sockets have already handled everything?

**Current understanding:**
- Sockets are faster and provide complete order data
- HTTP response is now **redundant for success cases**
- HTTP response only needed for **error handling** (if API fails, sockets won't arrive)

**Frontend behavior (April 2026):**
- New Order: Fire HTTP request (don't await), wait for `update-table engage` socket, then redirect
- Socket `update-table engage` → locks table
- Socket `new-order` → updates OrderContext
- HTTP errors shown via toast if API fails

---

## 9. Order-Engage Channel (April 10, 2026)

**New channel:** `order-engage_{restaurantId}`

**Purpose:** Order-level locking for Update Order operations. Works for ALL order types (dine-in, walk-in, takeaway, delivery).

**Why needed:**
- `update-table engage` only works for orders with physical tables
- Walk-in, TakeAway, Delivery have `tableId = 0` (no table to lock)
- `order-engage` locks the **order card** by orderId instead

**Message format (different from other channels):**
```javascript
// No event name at index 0!
[orderId, restaurantOrderId, restaurantId, status]
// Example: [730762, '008639', 644, 'engage']
```

**Flow:**
1. `order-engage` (status: 'engage') → Lock order card
2. `update-order` (with complete payload) → Update context
3. Auto-release order after context update (no 'free' socket)

---

## 10. Socket Payload Changes (April 10, 2026)

**v2 API endpoints now provide complete order data in socket events:**

| Event | v1 API | v2 API |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `new-order` | Partial, needs GET API | ✅ Complete 51-key payload |
| `update-order` | No payload, needs GET API | ✅ Complete payload |

**Impact:** No more `fetchSingleOrderForSocket()` calls for these events. Faster updates, less API load.
