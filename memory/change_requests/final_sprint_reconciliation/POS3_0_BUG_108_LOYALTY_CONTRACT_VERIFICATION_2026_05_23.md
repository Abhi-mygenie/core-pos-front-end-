# POS 3.0 BUG-108 — Loyalty Contract Verification (2026-05-23)

**Date:** 2026-05-23
**Sprint:** POS 3.0
**Bug / CR:** BUG-108 — Loyalty-First Implementation (per owner direction)
**Status:** `bug_108_loyalty_contract_partially_verified_waiting_api_gaps`
**CRM Handoff:** `/app/memory/crm/crm_1_0/handoff/CR_001C_LX_POS_BUG_108_LOYALTY_API_HANDOFF_TO_POS.md`

---

## 1. Status

```
bug_108_loyalty_contract_partially_verified_waiting_api_gaps
```

**Reason for "partially":** The CRM loyalty API contract is **complete and well-documented** (GREEN-LIGHT). However, 4 POS frontend code gaps and 1 environment gap must be resolved before implementation can begin. See §9 (API Gap Register) for details.

---

## 2. Owner Scope Clarification

Owner has directed:
- **Loyalty FIRST** — this is the immediate implementation target.
- **Coupon is NOT part of this immediate CR** — deferred to CR-001C-C.
- **Wallet is NOT part of this immediate CR** — deferred to CR-001C-W.
- **Redemption (loyalty/coupon/wallet debit/credit/reverse) is deferred** to a future CR.
- The goal is to verify whether loyalty read/display + calculated preview APIs are complete enough for POS frontend planning.

## 6. Loyalty Field Mapping Table

| CRM Source Field | Type | Example | POS Frontend Currently Reads | POS Payload Field | Required/Optional | Gap? |
|-----------------|------|---------|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------|
| `loyalty.tier` | string | `"Gold"` | Not consumed | — (display only) | Required | **YES — not mapped in customerTransform** |
| `loyalty.tier_label` | string | `"Gold Member"` | Not consumed | — (display only) | Optional | **YES — not mapped** |
| `loyalty.total_points` | int | `480` | `customer?.loyaltyPoints` (WRONG name) | `used_loyalty_point` | Required | **YES — field name mismatch** |
| `loyalty.ratio_per_point` | float | `1.5` | Not consumed (hardcoded 1:1) | — (calculation) | Required | **YES — not mapped** |
| `loyalty.points_value` | float | `720.0` | Not consumed | — (display only) | Required | **YES — not mapped** |
| `loyalty.loyalty_enabled` | bool | `true` | `restaurantSettings?.isLoyalty` only | — (UI gate) | Required | **YES — new gate needed** |
| Top-level `total_points` | int | `480` | `totalPoints` (transform) → but dropped in CartPanel | — | Existing | **YES — data pipeline broken** |
| Top-level `points_value` (lookup) | float | `720.0` | `pointsValue` (transform) → but dropped in CartPanel | — | Existing | **YES — data pipeline broken** |
| Top-level `wallet_balance` | float | `1200.0` | `walletBalance` (transform) → but dropped in CartPanel | `use_wallet_balance` | Out of scope | YES (known, wallet CR) |

### Critical Field Name Mismatches

| Where | Code reads | Should read (from CRM) | Issue |
|-------|-----------|------------------------|-------|
| `CollectPaymentPanel.jsx:507` | `customer?.loyaltyPoints` | `customer?.totalPoints` OR `customer?.loyalty?.total_points` | **Field does not exist on customer object** |
| `CollectPaymentPanel.jsx:1050` | `customer?.loyaltyPoints` | Same | Same — display always shows "0 pts" |
| `CollectPaymentPanel.jsx:508` | `Math.min(customer.loyaltyPoints, ...)` | Should use `points_value` (pre-calculated by CRM) | **Wrong calculation — uses raw points as rupees (1:1)** |

---

## 7. Redemption Calculation Mapping

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Who calculates redeemable amount? | **CRM backend** — `points_value = round(total_points * ratio_per_point, 2)` is returned pre-calculated |
| Can frontend derive amount from ratio? | Yes — `total_points * ratio_per_point` = `points_value`. But CRM already provides `points_value`, so frontend should use it directly. |
| Does backend return final allowed amount? | **Yes** — `points_value` is the final rupee value. No `max_usable_points` or `max_usable_amount` cap is documented. |
| Does loyalty apply before tax or after tax? | Current code applies to `itemTotal` (pre-tax). CRM contract does not specify — **needs owner clarification**. |
| Does loyalty combine with manual discount? | **Yes** — current code sums them: `totalDiscount = manualDiscount + presetDiscount + loyaltyDiscount + ...` (line 522). Owner Q9 confirmed combinability. |
| Does loyalty combine with coupon? | **Yes per Q9** — but coupon is out of scope for this CR. |
| Does loyalty combine with wallet? | Wallet deferred — current code sums them but wallet flag is `false`. |
| Is there a min redeemable points threshold? | **Not documented in CRM contract**. |
| Is there a max redeemable amount cap? | **Not documented in CRM contract**. |
| Rounding | CRM rounds `points_value` to 2 decimal places. POS should use this directly. |

### Calculation Flow (proposed for loyalty-live phase)

```
1. CRM returns: loyalty.points_value = 720.0 (pre-calculated)
2. POS displays: "720 pts available" (or "₹720 available")
3. Cashier enables "Use Loyalty" checkbox
4. loyaltyDiscount = Math.min(loyalty.points_value, itemTotal - manualDiscount)
5. used_loyalty_point = round(loyaltyDiscount / loyalty.ratio_per_point)
6. Payload sends: used_loyalty_point, loyalty_dicount_amount = loyaltyDiscount
```

**Key change from current code:** Current code uses `customer.loyaltyPoints` as both the point count AND the rupee value (1:1 ratio). New code must use `points_value` as the rupee cap, and back-calculate `used_loyalty_point` from the ratio.

---

## 8. POS Payload Safety Mapping

### `used_loyalty_point` (integer — points consumed)

| Phase | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| P1 (current, flags=false) | `0` | Force-zeroed by `BUG108_FLAGS.loyaltyRatioLive` guard |
| Loyalty read-only display | `0` | No redemption; display only |
| Loyalty calculated preview | `0` | Display preview amount but do NOT send in payload until redemption API exists |
| Loyalty real redemption (future) | `round(loyaltyDiscount / ratio_per_point)` | Only when redemption API (`POST /pos/loyalty/redeem`) is live |

### `loyalty_dicount_amount` (float — rupee discount applied, note: typo is intentional, matches backend field name)

| Phase | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| P1 (current, flags=false) | `0` | Force-zeroed |
| Loyalty read-only display | `0` | No redemption |
| Loyalty calculated preview | `0` | Display only — do NOT send in payload |
| Loyalty real redemption (future) | `loyaltyDiscount` (rupee amount) | Only when redemption API is live |

**Typo note:** The field is `loyalty_dicount_amount` (missing 's' in 'discount'). This matches the existing POS backend field name. Do NOT fix the typo — it would break the API contract.

## 9. API Gap Register

| Gap ID | Missing Item | Why Needed | Blocks Read-Only Display? | Blocks Redemption? | Priority |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------------------------|--------------------|---------| 
| **GAP-L1** | **CRM API key for test pod** — POS `.env` keys (`dp_live_*`) return "Invalid API key" against `crm-integration-test-3.preview.emergentagent.com` | Cannot call any CRM endpoint from POS preview | **YES** | YES | **P0 — BLOCKER** |
| **GAP-L2** | **Customer data pipeline broken** — `CartPanel.selectCustomer()` passes only `{ id, name, phone }` via `onCustomerChange`, dropping `totalPoints`, `walletBalance`, `tier`, `pointsValue`, and entire `loyalty` blob | Loyalty section will always show "0 pts" / "No points" | **YES** | YES | **P0 — BLOCKER** |
| **GAP-L3** | **Field name mismatch** — `CollectPaymentPanel.jsx` reads `customer?.loyaltyPoints` but customer object has `totalPoints` (from transform) or no such field (from CartPanel) | Loyalty display and discount calculation will always be 0 | **YES** | YES | **P0 — BLOCKER** |
| **GAP-L4** | **Loyalty blob fields not consumed** — `customerTransform.js` maps `api.loyalty || null` but does NOT extract `ratio_per_point`, `points_value`, `loyalty_enabled`, `tier_label` from the blob | Per-tier ratio unavailable; `loyalty_enabled` gate missing | **YES** | YES | **P1 — Required for implementation** |
| **GAP-L5** | **Loyalty math uses wrong formula** — Current code does `Math.min(customer.loyaltyPoints, itemTotal - manualDiscount)` treating points as rupees (1:1). New contract provides `points_value` (pre-calculated rupee equivalent). | Discount calculation will be wrong if ratio != 1.0 | No (display only doesn't calculate) | YES | **P1 — Required for calculated preview** |
| **GAP-L6** | **No `loyalty_enabled` gate in UI** — Current code gates on `restaurantSettings?.isLoyalty` but CRM now also returns `loyalty.loyalty_enabled`. Both gates needed. | Loyalty could show as enabled when CRM says disabled for this restaurant | **YES** (could show UI when it shouldn't) | YES | **P1 — Required** |
| **GAP-L7** | **No max usable points/amount cap documented** — CRM contract shows `points_value` but no `max_usable_points` or `max_usable_amount` or percentage cap | Unclear if full `points_value` is always redeemable | No | Partial | **P2 — Clarification needed** |
| **GAP-L8** | **No redemption API** — `POST /pos/loyalty/redeem` is deferred to future CR | Cannot actually debit points | No | **YES — BLOCKER** | **Future CR** |
| **GAP-L9** | **Removed keys from CRM response** — `points_monetary_value`, `redemption_value_per_point`, `next_tier`, etc. removed in LX-A | Must verify no POS code reads these | No (if verified clean) | No | **P1 — Verify before flip** |

## 10. Sample Data Coverage

| Customer Type | Available in CRM Handoff? | Sample Source |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Customer with no loyalty (no settings) | Partially — doc §5 says `loyalty_enabled=false`, `ratio=0.25` | Contract spec, no JSON sample |
| Customer with Bronze tier (low) | **Yes** — `cust_bronze_001`, 120 pts, ratio 0.25, value ₹30 | Handoff §4.1 + §4.2 |
| Customer with Silver tier (mid) | **Yes** — `cust_silver_002`, 620 pts, ratio 1.0, value ₹620 | Handoff §4.1 |
| Customer with Gold tier (high) | **Yes** — `cust_gold_003`, 480 pts, ratio 1.5, value ₹720 | Handoff §4.1 + §4.2 + §4.3 |
| Customer with Platinum tier | **No sample** — tier name documented but no sample JSON | Gap |
| Customer with zero points | **No sample** — field defaults to `0` per spec | Inferred |
| Customer with points but redemption disabled (`loyalty_enabled=false`) | **No sample** — behavior documented in §5 | Inferred |
| Customer with expiring points | **Not in contract** — no expiry fields documented | Gap — not in BUG-108 scope |
| Customer where max usable cap applies | **Not in contract** — no cap fields documented | Gap (see GAP-L7) |

## 11. Phase Recommendation

**Recommended: Phase B — Loyalty read-only + calculated preview**

| Phase | Description | Feasible now? |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| A. Read-only display only | Show tier, points, points_value. Checkbox disabled. | **YES** — once GAP-L1 through GAP-L4 fixed |
| **B. Read-only + calculated preview** | Show tier, points, points_value. Show "₹X redeemable" preview. Checkbox still disabled (no redemption API). | **YES** — once GAP-L1 through GAP-L6 fixed. **RECOMMENDED.** |
| C. Real redemption | Actually debit points on bill payment. | **NO** — blocked by GAP-L8 (no `POST /pos/loyalty/redeem` API) |
| D. Block until contract complete | Wait for all gaps resolved. | Not needed — contract is sufficient for Phase B. |

**Rationale for Phase B:**
- CRM provides `points_value` pre-calculated — POS can display it as "₹720 redeemable"
- Checkbox stays disabled (no redemption API), but the preview gives cashiers useful info
- Payload fields stay zero (no mutation)
- When redemption API lands (future CR), flip the flag and the math is already in place

---

## 12. Owner / CRM Questions

### Q-L1. Loyalty first phase should be:
- **A.** Read-only display only (show points/tier, everything disabled)
- **B.** Read-only + "estimated redeemable amount" preview (show "₹720 available", checkbox disabled) ← **Recommended**
- **C.** Real redemption (requires `POST /pos/loyalty/redeem` — not available yet)
- **D.** Wait until redemption API exists

### Q-L2. CRM test pod API key — which key should POS use?
The current `.env` keys (`dp_live_*`) return "Invalid API key" against `crm-integration-test-3.preview.emergentagent.com`. **Owner/CRM team must provide a valid API key for the test CRM pod, OR confirm the mapping for an existing restaurant.**

### Q-L3. Should `used_loyalty_point` and `loyalty_dicount_amount` remain zero until real redemption API exists?
- **A.** Yes — keep zero until `POST /pos/loyalty/redeem` is live ← **Recommended**
- **B.** No, send preview values (display-only amounts in payload)
- **C.** Backend to decide

### Q-L4. Is there a max usable points/amount cap per order?
- **A.** No cap — full `points_value` is always redeemable (up to order total)
- **B.** Cap exists — specify: max points ___ / max amount ₹___ / max % of order ___
- **C.** CRM backend will enforce cap and return `max_usable_amount` (requires contract update)

### Q-L5. Does loyalty discount apply before or after tax?
- **A.** Before tax (on `itemTotal`) ← **Current code behavior**
- **B.** After tax (on grand total)
- **C.** Backend decides (not frontend's concern)

---

## 13. Implementation Readiness Verdict

| Dimension | Ready? | Detail |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| CRM API contract documented | **YES** | Handoff doc GREEN-LIGHT, 3 endpoints, 6-key blob, 3-tier samples |
| CRM endpoints live in preview | **YES** | Health check passes, routes registered |
| CRM API key for POS preview | **NO** | GAP-L1 — current keys don't authenticate against test CRM |
| Customer data pipeline (POS) | **NO** | GAP-L2 — CartPanel drops CRM data; GAP-L3 — field name mismatch |
| Loyalty blob consumption (POS) | **NO** | GAP-L4 — customerTransform doesn't extract blob fields |
| Loyalty math formula (POS) | **NO** | GAP-L5 — hardcoded 1:1 ratio, needs points_value |
| `loyalty_enabled` gate (POS) | **NO** | GAP-L6 — UI doesn't check CRM's loyalty_enabled flag |
| Redemption API | **NO** | GAP-L8 — deferred to future CR (does NOT block read-only/preview) |

### Verdict

**Frontend planning CAN begin** — the CRM contract is complete and sufficient for loyalty read-only + preview.

**Frontend implementation CANNOT begin** until:
1. **GAP-L1** resolved (valid API key for test CRM) — **owner/CRM team action**
2. **GAP-L2 through GAP-L6** scoped in the implementation plan — **POS frontend team action**
3. **Q-L1 through Q-L5** answered by owner — **owner action**

Once these are resolved, the implementation agent can produce a CR Playbook-compliant file-level plan and begin coding.
