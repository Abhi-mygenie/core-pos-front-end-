# POS BUG-108 — Loyalty API Handoff to POS Team

> **🟢 STATUS: GREEN-LIGHT — POS may consume.**
>
> LX-A is implemented in CRM preview. Static QA (63/63) + read-only smoke
> on restaurant `18march` (5/5) passed on 2026-05-23. The 3 endpoints
> listed in §2 may now be consumed by POS in the preview environment.
> Prod deploy will happen in the joint batch with CR-001A Phase 2 +
> CR-001D (per CR-001C-L scope-lock §3 / D5).

**CR:** CR-001C-LX (bridge phase inside CR-001C-L Loyalty)
**Phase:** LX-A
**Date drafted:** 2026-05-22
**From:** CRM Team
**To:** POS 3.0 Frontend Team
**Re:** BUG-108 §3.3 (Loyalty tier → ratio configuration) — final API contract
**Parent docs:**
- `/app/memory/crm/crm_1_0/planning/POS3_0_BUG_108_API_INVENTORY_FOR_CRM_2026_05_22.md`

## 1. Scope of this Handoff

> **BUG-108 is handled in 3 CRM phases:**
> 1. **CR-001C-L Loyalty — active now**
> 2. **CR-001C-C Coupon — next**
> 3. **CR-001C-W Wallet — later**
>
> **This handoff covers only the Loyalty phase. Coupon and Wallet will receive separate CRM plans and handoffs.**

### Phase mapping (BUG-108 → CRM CRs)

| BUG-108 item | CRM owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| §3.3 Loyalty tier → ratio (this doc) | **CR-001C-L** | **Active — delivered in LX-A** |
| §3.1 `GET /pos/coupons/available` | CR-001C-C | Deferred — opens after Loyalty closes |
| §3.2 `POST /pos/coupons/validate` (BUG-108 body contract + `error.code`) | CR-001C-C | Deferred — opens after Loyalty closes |
| §3.x customer-coupon entitlement model | CR-001C-C | Deferred — opens after Loyalty closes |
| Wallet read-shape audit | CR-001C-W | Deferred — opens after Coupon closes |
| §4 redemption / debit / reversal endpoints | Future redemption CR | Deferred indefinitely per owner sign-off |

### What this doc covers (Phase 1 / Loyalty only)

- Tier-aware `ratio_per_point` exposed in 3 POS loyalty read endpoints.
- New per-tier configuration on the CRM Loyalty admin page (4 fields).

### What this doc explicitly does NOT cover

- BUG-108 §3.1 + §3.2 (coupon endpoints) → see CR-001C-C handoff (future).
- Customer-coupon entitlement model → see CR-001C-C handoff (future).
- Coupon `error.code` taxonomy → see CR-001C-C handoff (future).
- Wallet endpoints (read audit + debit / credit / reverse) → see CR-001C-W handoff (future).
- Any redemption / debit / reversal endpoints → future redemption CR.

## 2. Final Endpoint List (LX-A)

Three endpoints are touched. All other POS endpoints are unchanged.

| # | Endpoint | Auth | Change in LX-A |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | `POST /api/pos/customer-lookup` | `X-API-Key` | `points_value` is now **tier-aware** (uses customer's tier to look up the per-tier ratio). All other flat response fields unchanged. |
| 2.2 | `GET /api/pos/customers/{customer_id}` | `X-API-Key` | Nested `loyalty` blob is replaced with a **strict 6-key shape** (see §3). Top-level customer fields unchanged. |
| 2.3 | `GET /api/pos/customers/{customer_id}/loyalty` | `X-API-Key` | Response `data` is now the **strict 6-key loyalty blob** (see §3). |

All three call sites use a single shared helper `core.loyalty.build_pos_loyalty_blob(customer, settings)` — guaranteed identical math.

> **Note on URL prefix:** All endpoints are served behind `/api`. Full URL form is `${REACT_APP_CRM_BASE_URL}/pos/...`. The shorthand `/pos/...` used in BUG-108 inventory and below maps to `/api/pos/...` at the edge.

---

## 3. Final Response Shape — Loyalty Blob (6 keys, locked)

```json
{
  "tier": "Gold",
  "tier_label": "Gold Member",
  "total_points": 480,
  "ratio_per_point": 1.5,
  "points_value": 720.0,
  "loyalty_enabled": true
}
```

### Field definitions

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tier` | `string` | One of `"Bronze"`, `"Silver"`, `"Gold"`, `"Platinum"`. Defaults to `"Bronze"` if customer record has no tier. |
| `tier_label` | `string` | Human-friendly tier label. Derived as `"{tier} Member"` (e.g. `"Gold Member"`). Reserved for owner-configurable labels in a future CR; today always follows this pattern. |
| `total_points` | `int` | Current spendable points balance. Defaults to `0`. |
| `ratio_per_point` | `float` | **Rupees per point.** Resolution order: per-tier override → restaurant-level `redemption_value` → `0.25` default. |
| `points_value` | `float` | `round(total_points * ratio_per_point, 2)`. Rupee value of the customer's current balance. |
| `loyalty_enabled` | `bool` | Restaurant-wide kill-switch. If `false`, POS frontend SHOULD hide loyalty UI even though `points_value` is still numerically returned. |

### Removed (vs pre-LX shape) — DO NOT consume

The following keys were returned by the pre-LX version of `GET /pos/customers/{id}` and `GET /pos/customers/{id}/loyalty`. They are **NO LONGER RETURNED**:

| Removed key | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `points_monetary_value` | Use `points_value` |
| `redemption_value_per_point` | Use `ratio_per_point` |
| `next_tier` | Not exposed in BUG-108 contract. If needed, request via CR-001C-V or a future LX iteration. |
| `points_to_next_tier` | Same as `next_tier`. |
| `wallet_balance` (inside loyalty blob) | Use top-level `wallet_balance` on `GET /pos/customers/{id}` (unchanged at top level). |
| `earn_rate_percent` | Not exposed in BUG-108 contract. |
| `total_visits` (inside loyalty payload of endpoint 2.3) | Available on top-level of `GET /pos/customers/{id}`. |
| `total_spent` (same) | Same. |

POS team: please ensure no code path reads any of the removed keys before the GREEN-LIGHT banner flips. CRM has verified its own frontend does not consume these keys from the `/pos/*` endpoints.

### 4.2 `GET /api/pos/customers/{customer_id}`

**Bronze:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Customer found",
  "data": {
    "id": "cust_bronze_001",
    "name": "Ravi Kumar",
    "phone": "9876543210",
    "tier": "Bronze",
    "total_points": 120,
    "wallet_balance": 0.0,
    "loyalty": {
      "tier": "Bronze",
      "tier_label": "Bronze Member",
      "total_points": 120,
      "ratio_per_point": 0.25,
      "points_value": 30.0,
      "loyalty_enabled": true
    },
    "recent_orders": [],
    "addresses": []
  }
}
```

**Gold:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Customer found",
  "data": {
    "id": "cust_gold_003",
    "name": "Anita Verma",
    "phone": "9988776655",
    "tier": "Gold",
    "total_points": 480,
    "wallet_balance": 1200.0,
    "loyalty": {
      "tier": "Gold",
      "tier_label": "Gold Member",
      "total_points": 480,
      "ratio_per_point": 1.5,
      "points_value": 720.0,
      "loyalty_enabled": true
    },
    "recent_orders": [],
    "addresses": []
  }
}
```

---

### 4.3 `GET /api/pos/customers/{customer_id}/loyalty`

**Gold:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Loyalty summary",
  "data": {
    "tier": "Gold",
    "tier_label": "Gold Member",
    "total_points": 480,
    "ratio_per_point": 1.5,
    "points_value": 720.0,
    "loyalty_enabled": true
  }
}
```

---

## 5. Fallback Behavior — Where `ratio_per_point` Comes From

Resolution at request time (per-customer, every request):

```
1. settings.{tier.lower()}_redemption_value     (per-tier override; e.g. silver_redemption_value)
2. settings.redemption_value                    (restaurant-level legacy field)
3. 0.25                                         (final hardcoded fallback)
```

| Restaurant setup | What POS sees |
|---|---|
| Owner has not configured per-tier; `redemption_value = 1.0` (restaurant-level) | `ratio_per_point = 1.0` for every tier |
| Owner sets `gold_redemption_value = 1.5` only; `redemption_value = 1.0` | Gold customers see `1.5`; Bronze/Silver/Platinum see `1.0` |
| Owner sets all 4 per-tier values; `redemption_value` still set | Each tier sees its own per-tier value; restaurant-level ignored |
| Owner has NOT created `loyalty_settings` for the restaurant | `ratio_per_point = 0.25`, `loyalty_enabled = false` |

### `loyalty_enabled` semantics

- `true` → POS may show loyalty UI and treat `points_value` as redeemable.
- `false` → POS SHOULD hide loyalty UI. `points_value` is still returned numerically for informational/auditing purposes only.
- Missing `loyalty_settings` doc → `false`.

---

## 6. What Did NOT Change (LX-A)

| Endpoint | Change in LX-A? |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/pos/customers?search=` | **No change.** Same fields. |
| `POST /api/pos/customers` | **No change.** |
| `PUT /api/pos/customers/{id}` | **No change.** |
| `POST /api/pos/address-lookup` | **No change.** |
| `POST /api/pos/orders` | **No change.** |
| `POST /api/pos/coupons/validate` | **No change.** See §7. |
| `POST /api/pos/coupons/apply` | **No change.** See §7. |
| Any other endpoint | **No change.** |

---

## 7. Coupon Endpoints — Deferred to CR-001C-C

| BUG-108 item | Current state | Owner module |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /pos/coupons/available?customer_id=&order_total=&restaurant_id=` (§3.1) | **Does not exist** in CRM. | **CR-001C-C** (Coupons module) |
| `POST /pos/coupons/validate` with BUG-108 JSON-body contract + `error.code` taxonomy (§3.2) | Endpoint exists at `POST /api/pos/coupons/validate` (query-string contract, flat error messages). Will be reshaped to match BUG-108 contract inside CR-001C-C. | **CR-001C-C** |

---

## 8. Wallet & Redemption — Deferred

### 8.1 Wallet — CR-001C-W

Wallet **read fields** (`wallet_balance`) are already returned at top level by all relevant POS endpoints. LX-A does not change this.

Wallet **write paths** → **CR-001C-W** (Wallet module). Out of scope for LX-A.

### 8.2 Loyalty redemption — Future redemption CR

| Deferred endpoint | Reason |
|---|---|
| `POST /pos/loyalty/redeem` | Q4 — deferred to future redemption CR |
| `POST /pos/loyalty/reverse` | Q5 — no reversal needed |
| `POST /pos/coupons/redeem` | Q4/Q5 — deferred |
| `POST /pos/coupons/reverse` | Q5 — not needed |
| `POST /pos/wallet/debit` | Q4 — deferred |
| `POST /pos/wallet/credit` (refund) | Q5 — not needed |
| `POST /pos/wallet/reverse` | Q5 — not needed |

---

## 9. QA Evidence & Status

> **COMPLETE — LX-A implemented, static QA + read-only smoke passed on 2026-05-23.**

### 9.1 Static QA harness

- **Total assertions:** 63
- **Passed:** 63
- **Failed:** 0

### 9.2 Live read-only smoke (preview Mongo, restaurant `18march`)

- **GET `/api/pos/customers/{custA}`** — strict 6-key `loyalty` blob: PASS
- **GET `/api/pos/customers/{custA}/loyalty`** — strict 6-key payload: PASS
- **POST `/api/pos/customer-lookup`** — tier-aware `points_value`: PASS
- **Per-tier override test** — `bronze_redemption_value=1.5` → correct recalc: PASS
- **Mutation discipline** — only `loyalty_settings` touched then reverted: PASS

### 9.3 Status POS can rely on

**Current:** `cr001c_lx_a_loyalty_pos_contract_patched_qa_passed_in_preview`

## 10. Open Items POS Team Should Be Aware Of

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Admin UI for per-tier values | Not in LX-A. Owner sets values via `PATCH /api/loyalty-settings`. |
| `tier_label` customization | Today derived as `"{tier} Member"`. |
| `next_tier` / `points_to_next_tier` (removed) | Not in BUG-108 contract. |
| Coupon handoff | Separate document when CR-001C-C Stage E closes. |
