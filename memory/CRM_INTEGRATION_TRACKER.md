## Delivery Order Flow

```
1. Waiter selects "Delivery" order type
2. Waiter enters customer phone
3. POST /pos/customer-lookup (phone)
   ├── Found (registered: true)
   │   → Store customer_id, name, phone, tier, points, wallet
   │   → POST /pos/address-lookup (phone)
   │   → Show address picker (all addresses across all restaurants)
   │   → Default address pre-selected
   │
   └── Not found (registered: false)
       → Show "Create Customer" form
       → POST /pos/customers (create)
       → POST /pos/address-lookup (phone) — check cross-restaurant
       → Show address picker OR "Add New Address" form

4. Address picker options:
   ├── Select existing → use addr_id
   ├── Add new → POST /pos/customers/{id}/addresses → get addr_id
   └── Edit → PUT /pos/customers/{id}/addresses/{addr_id}

5. Place order payload:
   ├── address_id: "addr_xxx"
   ├── cust_name, cust_mobile, cust_email, cust_dob, cust_anniversary
   └── delivery_charge
```
