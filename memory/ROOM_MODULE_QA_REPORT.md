## 1. QA Summary

**Overall verdict: PASS with 1 P1 defect + 2 minor findings.** The Room Module V2 implementation is functionally correct against V2 spec and the Mygenie preprod backend. An end-to-end check-in (POST → HTTP 200 "Group check-in completed successfully" → dashboard updated) was successfully executed from the modal. 16 of 17 test cases passed. One P1 usability defect (phone-country auto-switch for Indian numbers) and two minor findings were observed — documented only, not fixed.

|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Click "Add Adult" | Row `#2` with name/id-type/front/back/remove testids | ✅ PASS |
| G2 | Keep clicking until cap | `maxAdults = 4 × 1 = 4` → 1 primary + 3 rows = 4 adults. Button disables after 3 rows. | ✅ PASS (`adultRows=3, btnDisabled=true, btnTitle="Maximum 4 adults"`) |
| G3 | Click "Add Child" | Child row `#1` with name + remove | ✅ PASS |
| G4 | Remove adult / child row | Row removed, counts update | ✅ PASS |

| D4 | Booking Type radio pills | `checkin-booking-type-walkin` + `checkin-booking-type-online` both present | ✅ PASS |
| D5 | Booking For radio pills | `checkin-booking-for-individual` + `checkin-booking-for-corporate` both present | ✅ PASS |
| D6 | Back-dating >24h | Date picker `min={yesterday}` — browser HTML-level blocks invalid selection | ✅ PASS via attribute inspection; runtime-typed dates not exercised |

### 3.6 Dirty-form guards (V2 §10.3, §10.4)

| # | Scenario | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| DF1 | Fill any field → click Cancel | Dirty prompt modal appears with testids `checkin-dirty-confirm-modal`, `dirty-dialog-cancel`, `dirty-dialog-discard` | ✅ PASS |
| DF2 | Click "Cancel" in the prompt | Prompt closes, modal stays open, form preserved | ✅ PASS |
| DF3 | Browser-nav (`beforeunload`) | Listener bound when `isDirty=true` | ✅ PASS (code inspected + React effect runs) — actual browser tab-close dialog not shown in headless mode, so runtime UI-level confirmation skipped |

### 3.7 End-to-end submit (V2 §8)

| # | Scenario | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Successful submit | POST multipart → 2xx → success toast → modal closes | ✅ **PASS** |

- Authorization header: `Bearer HyL1FQDdO917JZNMi...` (present)
- Response: **HTTP 200** · body: `{"message":"Group check-in completed successfully"}`
- Modal auto-closed (`room-checkin-overlay` count = 0 post-submit)
- Dashboard re-rendered: card `table-card-6182` now shows `e3 · QA Kavya E2E · Served 0m · C/Out` — room state transitioned from Available → Occupied ✅

## 5. Failed / Defect Cases — with steps to reproduce

### D-01 · P1 · Phone field auto-switches country to Iran when Indian users type their 10-digit number

**Severity:** P1 — high user-impact (Indian mobile numbers almost all start with `9`, which `react-phone-number-input` auto-detects as Iran `+98`).

**File involved:** `/app/frontend/src/components/modals/RoomCheckInModal.jsx` — `<PhoneInput international defaultCountry="IN" ... />`

**Repro steps:**
1. Log in as `owner@18march.com`.
2. Open the Room Check-In modal on any available room (e.g., `e3`).
3. Click the phone input (India flag shown, `+91` prefix).
4. Type `9876543210` (a normal Indian mobile number).

**Expected:** India flag stays; value becomes `+91 98765 43210`.

**Actual:** Country switches to Iran and value becomes `+98 76 5432 10`, with red inline error "Enter a valid phone number". The operator must manually reopen the country dropdown and re-select India.

**Root cause (observed):** The `international` prop on `<PhoneInput>` causes any input beginning with a digit that matches a country code prefix to switch countries. "98" matches Iran's calling code.

**Workaround that works (verified E2E):** explicitly typing `+91` before the digits. A regular human typing the national number without a prefix triggers the bug.

**Recommendation** (not applied, documented only): Either drop the `international` prop (which forces always-national parsing per `defaultCountry`), or switch to `country="IN"` (locks to India, no dropdown). Do this only after product confirms whether non-Indian guests are in scope.

### M-02 · Minor · Field-level "Required" errors persist visually after fields are filled

**Severity:** P3 — cosmetic/UX.

**File involved:** `RoomCheckInModal.jsx` — `errors` state is set only inside `validate()` on submit click.

**Repro steps:**
1. Submit empty form → Room Price and Order Amount show "Required" labels.
2. Type `2000` into both fields → values fill correctly.
3. The "Required" error label still renders under the now-filled input until the next submit click.

**Expected:** Per-field error text clears as soon as a valid value is typed.

**Actual:** Error text persists visually. Submission still works because `validate()` re-runs and sees valid values, but the UX is confusing.

**Recommendation:** Clear the specific `errors[fieldName]` onChange of each field.

### M-03 · Minor · Success toast wording mismatch (not a bug, just confirming)

**Severity:** P3 — informational only; no action needed.

**Observation:** On success, modal closes silently. The toast call happens (`toast({title: 'Group check-in completed successfully', ...})`) but, in the observed run, the shadcn toast didn't render in the screenshot (it may have already disappeared due to short duration + long Playwright `wait_for_timeout`). Backend response body confirms success: `{"message":"Group check-in completed successfully"}`. **No action required.**

## 6. Payload Observations

### 6.1 Request metadata (captured)
- **URL:** `https://preprod.mygenie.online/api/v1/vendoremployee/pos/user-group-check-in`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary5gdxSO0DqxIXngSM` ✅ (matches V2 §8.3)
- **Authorization:** `Bearer <token>` ✅
- **`X-localization` header:** NOT present ✅ (matches V2 requirement to remove)

### 6.2 Request body
- **Playwright `request.post_data` returned empty** — this is a known browser/Playwright limitation for multipart uploads sent as binary streams (the data is in `postDataBuffer` only, not exposed via `request.post_data` when files are attached).
- **Indirect proof that the body is well-formed:**
  1. Backend returned **HTTP 200** with `{"message":"Group check-in completed successfully"}` — the backend is strict; a malformed V2 payload would 400/422.
  2. Dashboard updated — `e3` transitioned Available → Occupied with the submitted guest name "QA Kavya E2E" visible.
  3. Bill printer log (from first test) recorded the created order.
- **Verified via static code inspection of `/app/frontend/src/api/services/roomService.js`:**
  - Always multipart (no JSON fallback) ✅
  - `room_id[0]`, `room_id[1]`, … bracket-indexed ✅
  - Currency fields → `toFixed(2)` 2-decimal strings ✅
  - Dates → `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss"` format ✅
  - `booking_details: ""` always appended when flag is Yes ✅
  - Adult rows #2..#N only appended when they exist (empty rows NOT sent) ✅
  - `children_name` comma-joined ✅
  - `payment_mode`, `gst_tax` NEVER appended ✅

### 6.3 Response shape
```
HTTP 200
Content-Type: application/json
Body: {"message":"Group check-in completed successfully"}
```
No `errors[]`, no `error` key — shape matches V2 §8.6 success envelope. 4-level error extraction fallback in `extractErrorMessage()` should be re-verified when a backend ever returns 4xx/5xx.

## 7. Screenshots & Logs

Screenshots taken during the QA run are in `/root/.emergent/automation_output/<timestamp>/` (Playwright headless session). Key moments captured (inline in tool output):

| Sequence | Content |
|---|---|
| Login page → filled credentials → dashboard | Confirmed successful auth |
| Dashboard with group-toggle enabled | Shows Dine-In / TakeAway / Delivery / Room columns. `e3` visible in Room column with "Available" sub-label |
| Modal open on `e3` | Full 3-column layout (Guest · Verification · Booking & Payment). GST block hidden when Personal selected. |
| Empty submit | All inline errors rendered. |
| Booking For = Corporate | GST/Firm block expanded with Firm Name and Firm GSTIN. |
| Adult rows at cap of 4 | 3 extra rows (#2, #3, #4), "Add Adult" button disabled, hover title "Maximum 4 adults". |
| Dirty-form prompt | Inline dialog with Cancel / Discard buttons. |
| Invalid file | Inline error "Only JPG, PNG, WEBP, or PDF files are allowed." |
| Successful E2E submit | Modal closed; dashboard now shows `e3 · QA Kavya E2E · Served 0m · C/Out` |

**Console logs (60+ lines captured):** all are expected platform logs (Socket subscriptions, Layout computations). No errors or warnings from the Room Check-In modal. No React warnings, no unhandled promise rejections, no 4xx/5xx network errors beyond the pre-existing (unrelated) endpoint 404 from an initial probe on wrong-URL `/api/v1/.../profile`.

**Raw artifacts saved:**
- `/app/memory/qa_payload_evidence.json` — the captured request + response pair
- `/app/memory/qa_validation_results.json` — round 1 (T01–T12) results
- `/app/memory/qa_validation_results_round2.json` — round 2 (T13–T16) results
- `/tmp/qa_console.txt`, `/tmp/qa_network.json` — raw network & console dumps

## 8. Backend Clarifications Needed

| # | Clarification | Why |
|---|---|---|
| BC-1 | **Multipart body inspection** — can backend team share a server-side dump of the raw form-data received from the QA submit (order #created at 2026-04-24T10:29 on restaurant 478 room e3 guest "QA Kavya E2E")? | Playwright cannot expose the serialized body for multipart-with-files. Server-side log would confirm bracket-indexed `room_id[0]`, 2-dp currency strings, `booking_details=""`, no `payment_mode`, no `gst_tax`. |
| BC-2 | **V2 §11 R1 confirmation** — multi-room + ≥5 adults: does the backend accept `name5`, `id_type5`, `front_image_file5`, `back_image_file5` keys, or is a different pattern required (e.g., array syntax `names[]`)? | Could not test — this tenant has only 1 non-engaged room (`e3`); cannot select 2+ rooms to raise the 4-adult cap. |
| BC-3 | **V2 §11 R4 confirmation** — is the backend accepting `id_type=Voter ID` (with space) as submitted by the modal? | Sent in this QA but not asserted in response; backend team should confirm storage. |
| BC-4 | **Error envelope shape** — the success response is `{"message":"..."}`. Can backend team share an example 4xx / 5xx payload shape so V2 §8.7 error extraction ordering (`errors[0].message` → `message` → `error`) can be final-verified? | No 4xx was produced in QA. |
| BC-5 | **409 conflict repro** — is there a way to simulate a taken-room race condition, or is this a very-rare code path? | Not reproducible in single-operator session. |
| BC-6 | **`show_user_gst=Yes` + Corporate + submit without GST info** — validation prevents this from happening client-side, but should backend reject it anyway as defense-in-depth? | Product decision. |
| BC-7 | **Phone field country policy** — should the modal restrict the phone picker to India only (`country="IN"`), or keep international support (fix the D-01 auto-switch differently)? | Product decision tied to D-01 defect remediation. |

---

## 9. Release Recommendation

### ✅ **Recommend: RELEASE to preprod UAT** with the following caveats:

**Ship-blockers:** None. The V2 implementation:
- Is functionally complete against V2 requirements.
- Successfully executes an end-to-end check-in against the Mygenie backend (HTTP 200).
- Preserves the room's state transition on the dashboard correctly.
- Has zero console/network errors in the observed session.

**Must-fix-before-production:**
- **D-01 (P1 phone country auto-switch)** — will affect every Indian operator typing mobile numbers starting with 9. Either restrict to `country="IN"` or remove the `international` prop. A ~10-minute change.

**Should-fix-before-production:**
- **M-02** — clear field-level error text onChange; minor polish, improves UX confidence.

**Backend confirmations needed in parallel (non-blocking for UAT):**
- BC-1 (raw body dump), BC-2 (adult-slot pattern ≥ #5), BC-3 (Voter ID string acceptance), BC-4 (error envelope samples).

**Not tested, deferred to production monitoring:**
- 409 race condition; large-image compression (≥10 MB), multi-restaurant flag permutations (this account was P4 maximal; P1/P2/P3 need tenants with different flag combinations); browser-level `beforeunload` dialog (requires human interaction).
